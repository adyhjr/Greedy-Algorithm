# Greedy-Algorithm

The goal of this project was to create a program that calculates the distance between a stationed depot and customers on a 2D plane and calculating the best route based on a greedy approach algorithm. For inputs, the user inputs the coordinates of an origin depot and the coordinates of each customer. These inputs are stored in paired vectors. For outputs, the total distance between the depot and customers is displayed as well as the most optimal route. There were several instances where I had to display some of the values stored in the distance vector. I kept this code and placed a deprecated doxygen comment to denote its use. Since this program heavily relies on the use of functions, there were several instances where I had to configure the parameters of some functions and alter what it returns.
